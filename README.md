<h1>StudyUnity</h1>

The goal of this project is to transform student learning by introducing an innovative
 platform that simplifies the sharing and accessing of resources. Through a
 user-friendly interface, students can easily share their class notes, relevant
 materials, YouTube links, and PDFs. The unique "Influence" system measures
 impact through upvotes, encouraging engagement and recognition. With the addition
 of dynamic group study features, the project promotes interactive learning.
 The newly introduced ranking system, determined by the "Influence" score,
 motivates participation and upholds content quality. By integrating collaboration,
 recognition, and resource sharing, the project empowers students to actively shape
 their educational journey and cultivate a culture of shared knowledge.
